> **Project Overview**

Employee turnover is a major challenge for organizations, with replacement costs ranging from 50% to 200% of an employee’s annual salary. This project develops and compares multiple machine learning models to predict employee attrition using real-world HR data.

By identifying employees at risk of leaving, organizations can shift from reactive resignation management to proactive retention strategies.
